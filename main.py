# The system executes Data Encryption standard algorithm in parallel and sequential approaches
# Encryption of a long text (famous story) and after that decryption to the initial text

# General python functions we used in this file:
# open() function opens a file, and returns it as a file object.
# float() method returns a floating point number from a number or a string.
# round() function returns a floating-point number rounded to the specified number of decimals.
# print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device.
# "w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content.
# time() returns the time as a floating point number expressed in seconds since the epoch, in UTC.
# range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1.
# map() function applies a function to each item of an iterable (list, tuple...) and returns a list
# of the results.
